1. Procedural programming (from the word itself na procedural) is a step-by-step programming process which vastly differentiates its characteristics onto Object-Oriented Programming 
na all about creating objects within classes for easier organization of your codes. OOP is easier than procedural kasi mas maoorganize mo yung code mo by the use of objects and classes and pwede mo pa siyang gawing hindi 
sunod-sunod, unlike procedural na the first thing it'll do is the first thing that you put. Another key difference is may set procedure yung sa procedural (may dapat sundan para magwork) while sa OOP technically pwedeng hindi
sunod-sunod as long as nadistinguish na different class sila.

2. GUI or Graphics User Interface is a digital interface that allows the users to interact with certain interactive features such as buttons, icons, textboxes, and etc.. Madaming cases
in which it can help in the field of geomatics, but what I can think of is by creating an app related to it such as converters or let's say building scanner or any other app na maaassociate sa 
geomatics. GUI is very well-known and well-used sa time natin ngayon and it helps in the field of geomatics by creating apps/programs na magpapadali sa pagaanalyze ng data, or maybe
pag-gather ng data itself.

3. When we say operation overloading in OOP, ito yung paggamit ng same operator, pero meron na silang different implementations. Let's say itong "*" (asterisk), ito yung code mostly sa pagmumumltiply
and pwede mo siyang iutilize in more ways than what it's usually meant to do. Example from 2*2 = 4 pwede mo siyang gamitin sa words such as (Ala)*2 which will result to AlaAla. It can be done in different 
classes, and syempre sa same classes rin, pero there's one thing to note about it which is it can make or break your work. (Multiple operator overloading isn't always recommended)

4. When we say inheritance, dito na tinatackle yung class hierarchy sa OOP. From the word itself na rin, merong nangyayaring "inheritance" or pag-borrow or pag-mana nung class. Nahahati kasi yan sa parent class 
(superclass or base class) and sa child class (subclass or derived class). Bale pwedeng gamitin ni child class lahat ng mga attributes ni parent class at mag-edit or magdagdag ng own attributes. Let's say na merong
parent class na animal, tapos pwede siyang gamitin ng child class na albino lion let's say. Sa animal, merong attribute na 4 legs, and binorrow yun ng child class then nagdagdag ng panibagong attribute which is color=white.
Let's say na child class naman na tiger, so pwede siyang magdagdag ng whiskers. Same lang halos ng process pero overall, in inheritance, a child class inherits the attributes of the parent class in which pwede niya
itong imodify and dagdagan.

5. Front-end is what the users see so dito nakalagay yung mga icons, buttons, and other interactive features na pwedeng pindutin or iinteract nung users (surface-level coding), Back-end is the one that does the dirty 
work (kumbaga ito na yung mas complicated na code na nagsusupply sa gagawin nung mga interactive features), while yung database yung nagcocontain ng lahat ng information. To elaborate let's set an example. Let's say
na nasa isang restaurant tayo, we can say na yung front-end is yung waiter kasi sila yung nakikipag-interact satin and sila yung lumalapit satin to take our order. Since nakaorder na tayo, syempre the waiter will give 
our order to the chef (in this case, siya yung back-end), ang gagawin nung chef ay lulutuin niya yung order natin, pero san siya kukuha nung lulutuin? Here comes the database part which is the fridge na nagcocontain
ng lahat ng ingredients para magawa yung order natin. To conclude, here's the relationship between the three (database-->back-end-->front-end)
